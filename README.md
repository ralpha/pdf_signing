This crate is a specialized crate that uses [`lopdf`][lopdf] to add signature images
to the pages and digitally sign a pdf.

NOTE: This crate is still work in progress and not all features are implemented at this moment.

This library only supports PNG images as the signature images.

## Examples

- Sign Document: `cargo run --example sign_doc` ([create cert first](./Create_Cert.md))
